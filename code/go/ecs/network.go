// The network is defined as the communication path over which a host or
// network event happens.
// The network.* fields should be populated with details about the network
// activity associated with an event.
type Network struct {
	// Name given by operators to sections of their network.
	Name string `ecs:"name"`

	// In the OSI Model this would be the Network Layer. ipv4, ipv6, ipsec,
	// pim, etc
	// The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See the
	// documentation section "Implementing ECS".
	Type string `ecs:"type"`

	// IANA Protocol Number
	// (https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml).
	// Standardized list of protocols. This aligns well with NetFlow and sFlow
	// related logs which use the IANA Protocol Number.
	IANANumber string `ecs:"iana_number"`

	// Same as network.iana_number, but instead using the Keyword name of the
	// transport layer (udp, tcp, ipv6-icmp, etc.)
	// The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See the
	// documentation section "Implementing ECS".
	Transport string `ecs:"transport"`

	// A name given to an application level protocol. This can be arbitrarily
	// assigned for things like microservices, but also apply to things like
	// skype, icq, facebook, twitter. This would be used in situations where
	// the vendor or service can be decoded such as from the source/dest IP
	// owners, ports, or wire format.
	// The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See the
	// documentation section "Implementing ECS".
	Application string `ecs:"application"`

	// L7 Network protocol name. ex. http, lumberjack, transport protocol.
	// The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See the
	// documentation section "Implementing ECS".
	Protocol string `ecs:"protocol"`

	// Direction of the network traffic.
	// Recommended values are:
	//   * inbound
	//   * outbound
	//   * internal
	//   * external
	//   * unknown
	//
	// When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this
	// field from the host's point of view.
	// When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring
	// context, populate this field from the point of view of your network
	// perimeter.
	Direction string `ecs:"direction"`

	// Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy.
	ForwardedIP string `ecs:"forwarded_ip"`

	// A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol
	// used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify
	// flows.
	// Learn more at https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec.
	CommunityID string `ecs:"community_id"`

	// Total bytes transferred in both directions.
	// If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes` is
	// their sum.
	Bytes int64 `ecs:"bytes"`

	// Total packets transferred in both directions.
	// If `source.packets` and `destination.packets` are known,
	// `network.packets` is their sum.
	Packets int64 `ecs:"packets"`

	// Locality of addresses involved in the exchange.
	// Locality can be either "private" or "public". "private" indicates that
	// both sides of the flow have IP addresses in the ranges reserved for
	// private networks as defined below. "public" indicates that at least one
	// side of the flow is outside of the private ranges. The IP addresses used
	// in determining this field's value are `source.ip` and `destination.ip`.
	// Address ranges that are considered private are:
	//   * Loopback (127.0.0.0/8, ::1/128)
	//   * Unspecified (0.0.0.0, ::)
	//   * IPv4 Broadcast (255.255.255.255)
