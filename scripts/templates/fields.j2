== {ecs} Field Reference

This is the documentation of ECS version {{ ecs_version }}.

ECS defines multiple groups of related fields. They are called "field sets".
The <<ecs-base,Base>> field set is the only one whose fields are defined
at the root of the event.

All other field sets are defined as objects in {es}, under which
all fields are defined.

Below is the complete list of field sets in {ecs}. Before diving head first into this list,
make sure to review <<ecs-overview-field-sets>>.
